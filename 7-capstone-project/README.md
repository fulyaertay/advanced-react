## Capstone Project: Photo Store
It is an eCommerce site that pulls all my new React knowledge together. You can access the random photos with the detail. I used the React context to provide and distribute photos. The photos is taken from the [Scrimba Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobziroll/scrimba-react-bootcamp-images/master/images.json).
